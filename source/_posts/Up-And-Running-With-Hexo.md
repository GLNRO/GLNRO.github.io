I am always tremendously grateful for the pedagogical stewards of 'hacking around on the internet' who take the time to explain how to get up and running with the new Derp.js framework or Whale Box, the containerized deployment platform. After years of procrastination and being above writing blog posts, I will humbly attempt to throw in my two copper .01 USD coins, and walk through how to start a Hexo blog hosted on Github Pages.


### What is Hexo?
I am a fan of reading docs, and the docs would like you to know that *Hexo is a fast, simple and powerful blog framework*; posts are written in Markdown and the framework generates static files with pre-packaged themes that can also be customized.

Here are the Hexo [docs](https://hexo.io/docs/)
Here is the [Markdown guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) I always pull up by googling *how to write markdown* every time I have to write Markdown.
